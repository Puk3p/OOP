# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory - Lab 5

## Overview
This repository hosts laboratory exercises for Lab 5 of the C++ programming course, which dives into advanced object-oriented programming concepts such as static class members, the `this` pointer, copy constructors, and more. The lab is designed to provide a deep understanding of these advanced features and their practical applications.

- **Static Class Members**
- **The `this` Keyword**
- **Copy Constructors**
- **Class Pointers**
- **Lab Exercises**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. Static Class Members
- **Understanding Static Members**: Learn about static data members and methods, how they exist independently of class instances, and how they can be accessed.

### 2. The `this` Keyword
- **Usage of `this`**: Explore how `this` provides a pointer to the current object instance within non-static member functions, allowing for self-referencing and method chaining.

### 3. Copy Constructors
- **Implementing Copy Constructors**: Understand the role of copy constructors in C++, when they are invoked, and how to define them to manage deep copies of class objects.

### 4. Class Pointers
- **Pointers to Classes**: Exercises on creating and manipulating pointers to class instances, including dynamic allocation and deallocation.

## Lab Assignment: Implementations and Challenges

### Objective
Implement various classes using advanced OOP features to understand memory management, constructor usage, and the behavior of the `this` pointer.

### Tasks
1. **Implement a `Person` Class**:
   - Create a class with static members and methods.
   - Use `this` to access object members and manage memory in constructors and destructors.

2. **Create a `Complex` Class**:
   - Implement a class to handle complex numbers with methods for addition, which utilize the copy constructor.
   - Provide methods that utilize the `this` pointer for method chaining.

3. **Advanced Exercises**:
   - Implement a `ComplexSet` class that manages a set of `Complex` numbers.
   - Add methods to add and remove elements, leveraging deep copy techniques and class pointers.

### Expected Deliverables
- Source code for all classes.
- Detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each component.
- A main program that tests all functionalities, including dynamic memory management and copy constructor behaviors.

## Testing and Validation
- Instructions for compiling and running the program.
- Use cases to validate the correct implementation of static members, copy constructors, and pointer manipulations.

## Discussion
- Analyze how static members behave across different instances of the class.
- Discuss the difference between shallow and deep copying, and when each is appropriate.
- Explore the implications of pointer manipulations in class design and memory management.
