# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory - Lab 10

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory exercises for Lab 10 of the C++ programming course, focusing on the use of templates for both functions and classes. This lab aims to provide an understanding of generic programming which allows writing code that works with any data type.

## Contents
- **Function Templates**
- **Class Templates**
- **Lab Exercises**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. Function Templates
- **Implementing Function Templates**: Learn how to create function templates that can operate on data of any type, which eliminates the need for multiple function definitions for different data types.

### 2. Class Templates
- **Creating and Using Class Templates**: Explore how to define templates for classes that can be used to create objects that work with any specified type, such as containers or complex data structures.

## Lab Assignment: Implementations and Challenges

### Objective
Develop a set of templates for both functions and classes that demonstrate the power of generic programming by creating flexible and reusable components.

### Tasks
1. **Implement a Max Function Template**:
   - Create a template function that returns the maximum of two given values.
   - Test this function with different data types (int, float, double).

2. **Vector Manipulation Class Template**:
   - Design a template class for a dynamic array (vector) that supports basic operations like element access and size management.
   - Implement methods for adding elements and clearing the vector.

3. **Complex Data Type Operations**:
   - Create a class template that handles a complex data type, such as a `Car` with attributes like color and year.
   - Ensure the class supports comparison operations by overloading necessary operators.

### Expected Deliverables
- Source code for all templates demonstrating their use with various data types.
- Documentation explaining the purpose and functionality of each template.
- A main program that demonstrates the use of function and class templates with examples of different data types.

## Testing and Validation
- Instructions for compiling and running the program.
- Test cases to verify that templates work correctly across different data types.

## Discussion
- Discuss the advantages of using templates in reducing code redundancy.
- Evaluate the impact of templates on code maintainability and performance.
