# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory - Lab 7

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory exercises for Lab 7 of the C++ programming course, focusing on inheritance in C++. The lab aims to deepen understanding of how to use inheritance to create hierarchical class structures, thereby promoting code reusability and simplicity.

## Contents
- **Introduction to Inheritance**
- **Accessing Base Class Members**
- **Object Creation and Deletion**
- **Class Hierarchies**
- **The `Person` Project**
- **Lab Exercises**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. Introduction to Inheritance
- **Basics of Inheritance**: Learn how to derive a class from a base class and understand the implications of inheritance on access control.

### 2. Accessing Base Class Members
- **Using Protected Members**: Explore how derived classes can access protected members of the base class.

### 3. Object Creation and Deletion
- **Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance**: Understand the order of constructor and destructor calls in an inheritance hierarchy.

### 4. Class Hierarchies
- **Building Class Hierarchies**: Learn how to structure complex class hierarchies using public, protected, and private inheritance.

### 5. The `Person` Project
- **Practical Application**: Apply inheritance concepts to a real-world example, enhancing a basic `Person` class to include derived classes such as `Student` and `Employee`.

## Lab Assignment: Implementations and Challenges

### Objective
Develop a system of classes using inheritance to demonstrate relationships and feature sharing between classes, simulating real-world entities.

### Tasks
1. **Implement a `Student` Class**:
   - Derive the `Student` class from the `Person` class.
   - Add specific attributes like group and academic information.

2. **Create an `Employee` Class**:
   - Extend the `Person` class to include employment-related data such as job title and employment date.
   - Implement methods to calculate work duration and other job-related metrics.

3. **Advanced Class Hierarchies**:
   - Design a multi-level inheritance structure, possibly including multiple base classes for a more complex scenario.

### Expected Deliverables
- Source code for all classes, showing inheritance relationships.
- Documentation and comments explaining the functionality and connections between classes.
- A main program that demonstrates the use of derived classes, including creating and managing objects of these classes.

## Testing and Validation
- Instructions for compiling and running the program.
- Test cases to verify the correct implementation of inheritance and class functionalities.

## Discussion
- Discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of using inheritance in software design.
- Analyze how different access specifiers affect the usability and security of class members in an inheritance hierarchy.
