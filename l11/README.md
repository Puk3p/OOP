- **Sorting with Algorithm Library**
- **Proposed Problems**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. Standard I/O Functions
- **Exploration of `<iostream>`, `<iomanip>`, and `<fstream>`**: Understand how to use standard streams like `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog` for input and output operations.

### 2. String Manipulation
- **Working with `<cstring>` and `<string>`**: Learn to manage C-style and C++ style strings using standard library functions.

### 3. Iterators
- **Understanding Iterators**: Use iterators to navigate through containers like strings and vectors.

### 4. Vector Class
- **Utilizing `<vector>`**: Gain proficiency in using the vector class for dynamic array management.

### 5. Algorithm Library
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Apply sorting algorithms from the `<algorithm>` library to order data within containers.

## Lab Assignment: Implementations and Challenges

### Objective
Implement and test standard library functionalities with practical programming tasks, ensuring a solid understanding of how to integrate these libraries into C++ applications.

### Tasks
1. **Implement Standard I/O Operations**:
   - Practice using `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog` with various data types.
   - Redirect output streams to files.

2. **String Functions and Classes**:
   - Perform operations like copying, concatenation, and searching within strings using both C-style strings and the `string` class.

3. **Vector Operations**:
   - Create and manipulate vectors, including element insertion and access.
   - Use iterators to traverse and modify vector contents.

4. **Apply Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Sort data using built-in functions and custom comparison operators.

### Expected Deliverables
- Source code implementing each of the standard library features discussed.
- Documentation detailing the purpose and use of each function and class.
- A main program that demonstrates effective use of the C++ Standard Library for common tasks.

## Testing and Validation
- Instructions for compiling and running the program.
- Test cases demonstrating the correct application of library functions and classes.

## Discussion
- Discuss the efficiency and utility of various standard library components.
- Analyze the impact of using standard versus custom functions for typical programming tasks.
