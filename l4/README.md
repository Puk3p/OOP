# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory - Lab 4

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory exercises for Lab 4 of the C++ programming course, focusing on the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and access specifiers. This lab aims to enhance understanding of how to structure and implement object-oriented programs in C++.

## Contents
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Access Specifiers**
- **Constructors and Destructors**
- **Exercises**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. Classes
- **Introduction to Classes**: Learn to define a new data type by creating classes, which are an extension of C structures but with added capabilities to include both data and functions (methods).

### 2. Objects
- **Instantiation**: Exercises on creating instances of classes, known as objects, and understanding static and dynamic object creation.

### 3. Access Specifiers
- **Private and Public**: Understand the use of `private` and `public` access specifiers to control the accessibility of class members.

### 4. Constructors
- **Role and Types of Constructors**: Learn about constructors, which are special methods used to initialize objects. Types covered include default constructors, parameterized constructors, and copy constructors.

### 5. Destructor
- **Implementing Destructors**: Learn how to define destructors for classes to manage resource deallocation and understand the automatic invocation of destructors for object cleanup.

## Lab Assignment: Implementations and Exercises

### Objective
Implement classes with detailed attributes and methods, utilizing constructors for initialization and destructors for cleanup, practicing memory management and object-oriented principles.

### Tasks
1. **Class Implementations**:
   - Implement a `Rectangle` class with methods for setting dimensions and calculating area.
   - Explore the use of different constructors within the `Rectangle` class to understand their utility and impact.

2. **Exercises**:
   - Implement a `Multime` class to represent a set of integers, managing elements with dynamic memory.
   - Develop a `Stiva` (Stack) class with typical stack operations (push, pop, top, print).

### Expected Deliverables
- Source code for all classes and methods.
- Documentation and comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.
- A main program to demonstrate and test the classes and methods implemented.

## Compilation and Testing
- Instructions for compiling and running the program.
- Example test cases to verify the functionality of implemented classes.

## Discussion
- Discuss the implications of using different types of constructors.
- Explore how access specifiers affect the security and usability of class members in larger software projects.
